I tried searching for some good scripts but sometimes just making it yourself is way faster than searching, testing and adjusting someone elses script. Since this is quite a usefull script, and since I&#8217;ve done my share of shamelessly &#8216;ripping&#8217; other peoples scripts, I thought it would be nice to share it. All you have to do is add the script in the html head and give your unordered list the classname &#8216;foldtree&#8217;. Further instructions are in the script itself.
