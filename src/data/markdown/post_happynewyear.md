# happy newyear

We&#8217;re really busy at <a href="http://www.shapers.nl/" target="_blank">Shapers</a> these days but I found some spare time (weekend) to make a <del data-href="game/2005en.swf">christmas/newyears card</del>. Niels found it a bit cruel to send to clients &#8230; but hey clients are cruel to us to!
