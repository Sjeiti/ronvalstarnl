# WordPress

<p>For years I&#8217;ve been using my own CMS which actually started as a sort of personal project to learn more php. And now that I know how to write php I&#8217;m too lazy to extend or rewrite my own CMS so I&#8217;ve poored all my data into <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, which seems to be the most popular php blog type of thing around. There&#8217;s still a lot of stuff to implement correctly (the entire code portfolio, long lines for sifr, stats, upload) and there&#8217;s a lot of things I want different from the default settings. So I imagine it&#8217;ll keep me busy some time (especially writing a good upload plugin).</p>
