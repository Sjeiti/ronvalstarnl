# SFBrowser

<p>Most content management systems have a fairly crummy way of uploading and managing files. With jQuery and PHP I made a very extensive file uploader that can be hooked onto any CMS. You can even port it to a different server side language through the use of connectors.</p>
<p>I pulled the plug on this project in 2013, but I do have a half-finished Angular implementation lying around for when I am really bored.</p>
