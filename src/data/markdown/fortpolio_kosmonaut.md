# Kosmonaut

<p>Kosmonaut makes music videos. Their site had to be simple. They provided me with photographs from their desk, some post-its, and that&#8217;s it.<br />
Navigating is done by moving the mouse on the desktop. The bitmap of the timber is calculated when changing screen size again. In connection with its rotation, the width and height is equal to the diagonal of the screen. Because large bitmaps on some computer processors are intensive, a smaller screen will run smoother.<br />
The content is loaded in the form of its own XHTML page.</p>
