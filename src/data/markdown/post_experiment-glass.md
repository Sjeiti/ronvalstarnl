# Experiment: glass

One of the nicest emergent behaviours I know is recursion. For this experiment a screenshot is taken and placed at a different angle, offset and scale. Then repeated indefinitely. For colouring I added a really light gradient each cycle (otherwise the image would recurse into a single colour).<br />
The result looks mostly fractal.
