# sheep

<p>I had some free time at <a href="http://www.shapers.nl/" target="_blank">Shapers</a> and started <del>this little game</del>, though soon I was over my head in work and had to finish it at home. Luckily I have a <a href="http://www.jurida.com/" target="_blank">very patient girlfriend</a> (who happened to create the sounds for this game).</p>
