# Vodafone

<p>As senior-developer in the front-end team at Vodafone there were several projects I contributed to. The largest was rebuilding the entire shop into a single page application using Angular. One of my responsibilities was laying down the basic structure and workflow for the framework as well as creating new build scripts (moving from Grunt to just NodeJS).<br />
Along the way I added several improvements to the build process and overall code quality.</p>
