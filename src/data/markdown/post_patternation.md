Desktop patterns are <del data-href="http://www.k10k.net/frames.aspx?section=patterns">cool</del>. I couldn&#8217;t find any good programs that could easily make them so I made one myself. You can choose between 16 preset patterns and there is also a random() function! Only drawback in this version is that shockwave does not allow you to save directly to your computer. But you can paste it to your clipboard and then paste the clipboard into a program like ms paint to save it. </p>
