# WOOT FWA SOTD!!!

<p>The <a href="http://www.soundcircus.nl/" rel="external">Kees Kroot website</a> I made for <a href="http://www.poolworldwide.com/" rel="external">Pool</a> has gone &#8221;site of the day&#8221; at <a href="http://www.thefwa.com/" rel="external">theFWA</a>.<br />
That does make me proud. But of course it&#8221;s not just me that deserves credit, also the people at <a href="http://www.poolworldwide.com/" rel="external">Pool</a> (Matthijs, Sip, Mayke etc&#8230;), and <a href="http://www.krijnvannoordwijk.com/" rel="external">Krijn van Noordwijk</a> for the very cool photography.<br />
<!--On the other hand I do have a bit of mixed feelings about theFWA. What bothers me is that practically everything in there is Flash. Most of the sites look great and, well... that''s just it: they only look great. For the rest it''s just too much loading, too processor intensive, time wasting screen transitions ... [insert numerous Flash downsides here]. Have all the agencies forgotten about HTML? Even the FWA site itself is in Flash while it could easily have been built in HTML. Or maybe it''s just me.--></p>
