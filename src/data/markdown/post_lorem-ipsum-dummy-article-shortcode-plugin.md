# Lorem ipsum dummy article shortcode plugin

<p>I&#8217;ve been using a lorem-ipsum generator for WordPress development for the last few years but there were some features that could be implemented better and some features that I missed.<br />
Normally I try to contribute to existing code instead of reinventing the wheel. But the plugin I used hadn&#8217;t been updated in over two years (apart from a version bump). A ticket I filed two years earlier hadn&#8217;t been reacted upon so I decided to roll my own.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Once I got going I thought of numerous other features to implement. The main goal was not to generate lorem-ipsum text but to fake what a post or page might look like. So this includes headings, hyperlinks, strong/em, blockquotes, lists and images. And of course random lorem-ipsum text with a random seed (which is why I started this in the first place). </p>
<p>You can get the plugin on <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/lorem-ipsum-dummy-article-shortcode/">WP</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Sjeiti/Lorem-ipsum-dummy-article-shortcode/">Github</a>.</p>
