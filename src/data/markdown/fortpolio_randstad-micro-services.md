# Randstad microservices

Front-end developer in a team to rebuild existing monolithic functionalities to orchestrated microservices. I developed white-label Angular components for different Randstad operating companies.
Apart from my responsibilities in the team, I also had a leading role in moving and aligning all front-end projects to an Nx-based monorepository, housing Angular as well as vanilla and React. This included setup of generated Markdown documentation, as well as different Storybooks for the design system.
