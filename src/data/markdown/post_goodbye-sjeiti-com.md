# Goodbye sjeiti.com

With some reluctancy I changed my domain name from sjeiti.com to ronvalstar.nl last weekend. Sjeiti.com [had been online for sixteen years](https://web.archive.org/web/*/sjeiti.com) (I had to do a WHOIS lookup for that: since may 1999).

Sjeiti.com was my first domain. When I left [Shapers](http://www.shapers.nl/) in 2007 I figured I needed a proffesional portfolio so I got ronvalstar.nl (in Dutch).  
I had been playing with the idea of merging the two for some time because I didn’t want to maintain two separate sites -and- a cv. It was also a bit weird to have a portfolio site and point people to a different site for all the cool stuff. Until last weekend I hadn’t quite figured out which direction to take, which one to keep and in what language. But when I finally made up my mind (a Dutch domain in English) I got it done within two hours.

And because it’s a bit sad to let something go, here’s a laugh: sjeiti.com and it’s predecessors (on a different domain) since 1996.  
(I had these lying around, I’ll try and update this post with the latest versions)
