## dependencies

This entire site is [home-grown vanilla JS](/refactoring-for-speed). There *are* a few third party packages bundled. 

 - [@emmetio/expand-abbreviation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@emmetio/expand-abbreviation)
   The templating system uses Emmet-notation (because I'm too lazy to write HTML)
 - [prismjs](https://prismjs.com/)
   Source code examples nicely formatted, gotta love Prismjs.
 - [state-signals](https://sjeiti.github.io/state-signals/)
   Events are dispatched through signals.


## hosting

Sources are hosted on [Github](https://github.com/), build through [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), while the domain name is registered through [DDS](https://dds.nl/) (an [Unesco MoW](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_of_the_World_Programme)).
