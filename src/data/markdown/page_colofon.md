## dependencies

This entire site is [home-grown vanilla JS](/refactoring-for-speed). There *are* a few third party packages bundled. 

 - [@emmetio/expand-abbreviation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@emmetio/expand-abbreviation)
   The templating system uses Emmet-notation (because I'm too lazy to write HTML)
 - [gsap](https://gsap.com/)
   There is some controlled animation here and there, I could probably do without this package and use plain CSS though.
 - [prismjs](https://prismjs.com/)
   Source code examples nicely formatted, gotta love Prismjs.
 - [state-signals](https://sjeiti.github.io/state-signals/)
   Events are dispatched through signals.
