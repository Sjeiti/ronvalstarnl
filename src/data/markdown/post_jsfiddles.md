# JSFiddles

There are quite a lot of online sandbox environments online in which you can quickly mockup HTML, CSS and JS. There's [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [plnkr](https://plnkr.co/), [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com), [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) and [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/) to name a few.

I myself have always been fond of JSFiddle.

```html 
<!--example-->
<style>
@import url(//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Istok+Web:400,700);
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  background: transparent;
  box-shadow: none;
  font-family: 'Istok Web', sans-serif;
  font-size: 1rem;
}
@media (min-width: 736px) {
  * {font-size: 1.125rem; }
}
body { padding-right: 1rem; }
</style>
I even coded the code examples in my site in such a way that you can open them as JSFiddle if you press that button â†—
<script>console.log('See?')</script>
``` 

No particular reason why I would use it over the other sandboxes mentioned, maybe it's the simplicity. I use it for [testing functionality](https://jsfiddle.net/Sjeiti/L0wy29an/), quick mockups like this [skeleton loader](https://jsfiddle.net/Sjeiti/eym7nu4a/) or even to make [quick illustrations](https://jsfiddle.net/Sjeiti/0zq5sn3o/). I do use CodeSandbox from time to time if I want to quickly test something more complex.


## Ten years equals threehundredandforty fiddles

I have been using JSFiddle for about ten years now. That is 17 pages of fiddles, which amounts to `17 * 20 = 340` fiddles. Since I never bothered to clean it up it is of course filled with junk. But there are some nice little ones that are maybe worth showing. So I thought I'd sift throught them and list them below (and maybe cleanup along the way).


### The oldest

<div class="example-fiddle">

The nice thing about this one is that it is the oldest one, written with jQuery, using `setTimeout`, systems Hungarian notation. All stuff I don't do anymore. But we all came from somewhere, had phases, do everything we used to do differently now. Except using `asdf` for quick names, `asdf` and `poepjes`.

</div>


### One element

<div class="example-fiddle">

Once I had the idea the logo I use should be a single element: some psuedo selectors, roundings and transformations.

<!--jsfiddle:twMhY-->

</div> 


### Project invoice spinner

Animating SVG is a tricky thing (since we lost Flash). This here is the mockup of the loading spinner used in [project invoice](https://projectinvoice.nl/).

<!--jsfiddle:dztazgub-->


### Middle ellipsis

The ellipsis is used to shorten text and show there is more. But using it as a suffix is sometimes not handy if a list of strings all start the same. An ellipsis in the middle can make a list clearer because you can see the ending of the string. Unlike `overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis;` this should be coded and updated on resize.

<!--jsfiddle:cxsqv50n-->


### Pinch generator

A generator written to help traverse an array starting somewhere in the middle and making your way outwards. The generator is used in the [giant lists post](/fast-giant-lists).

<!--jsfiddle:rtb5uhhv-->


### Paper shade

This note is just one HTMLElement and some CSS. Note the layered shadow for realism. CSS is underrated. 

<!--jsfiddle:6awmp7sk-->


### A command line interface

It's a bit cliche to use command line interfaces in designs, so I eventually removed it from [the disconnect project](/project/disconnect).

<!--jsfiddle:xqdruj1e-->


### Proxy keymap

Most developers I know never use(d) Proxy because it is a bit abstract. Well, basically you can use it for anything you'd normally have to define a lot of properties for: like this keyboard binding example.
Here is a good use-case for 

<!--jsfiddle:a9xk6cme-->


### HTML to image

Yeah that, but in a weird stupid way (should be way easier).

<!--jsfiddle:Lgm50j8y-->


### Golden angles

This is a great example how I sometimes use JSFiddle: for [the disconnect project](/project/disconnect) I needed a pattern or form to place 28 pieces of content in nine chapters. This here is the start of finding that form:

<!--jsfiddle:ub9sztk5-->


### A cardboard box

Like I said: CSS is underrated.

<!--jsfiddle:sqb7Lo5e-->


### Trippy background

Totally forgot what this was for, but it looks nice.

<!--jsfiddle:xwohszrc-->


### Rainbow box

An illustration for [the MC Picker blog post](/mc-picker)

<!--jsfiddle:21wo6bc0-->


### Zandloper

This spinner used on this site

<!--jsfiddle:4n12ytxf-->


### CSS background

Just a nice background-gradient in CSS ([think I saw it here](https://nxtmuseum.com/)).

<!--jsfiddle:v37cn5gk-->


### Text gradients

Totally forgot about text gradients

<!--jsfiddle:w5udqrf2-->
