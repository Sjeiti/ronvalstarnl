# JSFiddles

There are quite a lot of online sandbox environments in which you can quickly mockup HTML, CSS and JS. There's [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [plnkr](https://plnkr.co/), [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com), [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) and [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/) to name a few.

I myself have always been fond of JSFiddle. I cannot think of a particular reason why, maybe it's the simplicity.

I use it for [testing functionality](https://jsfiddle.net/Sjeiti/L0wy29an/), quick mockups like this [skeleton loader](https://jsfiddle.net/Sjeiti/eym7nu4a/) or even to make [quick illustrations](https://jsfiddle.net/Sjeiti/0zq5sn3o/). I do use CodeSandbox from time to time if I want to quickly test something more complex.


## Threehundredandforty fiddles

I have been using JSFiddle for about ten years now. 17 pages of fiddles, which amounts to `17 * 20 = 340` fiddles. I never bothered to clean it up so a lot of it is junk. But there are some nice little ones that are maybe worth showing. So I thought I'd sift through all of them and list some nicer ones below (and maybe cleanup along the way).


### The oldest

<div class="flexM">

The nice thing about this one is that it is the oldest one, written with jQuery, using `setTimeout`, systems Hungarian notation. All stuff I don't do anymore. But we all came from somewhere, had phases, do everything we used to do differently now. Except using `asdf` for quick names, `asdf` and `poepjes`.

<div data-jsfiddle="EaNPh"></div>

</div>


### One element

<div class="flexM">

Once I had the idea the logo I use should be a single element: some psuedo selectors, roundings and transformations.

<div data-jsfiddle="twMhY"></div>

</div> 


### Project invoice spinner

<div class="flexM">

Animating SVG is a tricky thing (since we lost Flash). This here is the mockup of the loading spinner used in [project invoice](https://projectinvoice.nl/).

<div data-jsfiddle="dztazgub"></div>

</div>


### Middle ellipsis

<div class="flexM">

The ellipsis is used to shorten text and show there is more. But using it as a suffix is less clear if a list of strings all start the same. An ellipsis in the middle can be better because you can see the ending of the string. Unlike `overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis;` this should be coded and updated on resize.

<div data-jsfiddle="cxsqv50n"></div>

</div>


### Pinch generator

<div class="flexM">

A generator written to help traverse an array starting somewhere in the middle and making your way outwards. The generator is used in the [giant lists post](/fast-giant-lists).

<div data-jsfiddle="rtb5uhhv"></div>

</div>


### Paper shade

<div class="flexM">

This note is just one HTMLElement and some CSS. Note the layered shadow for realism. What you can do with CSS is really underrated. 

<div data-jsfiddle="6awmp7sk" style="height:27rem;flex: 0 0 var(--gold-l);"></div>

</div>


### A command line interface

<div class="flexM">

It's a bit cliche to use command line interfaces in designs, so I eventually removed it from [the disconnect project](/project/disconnect).

<div data-jsfiddle="xqdruj1e"></div>

</div>


### Proxy keymap

<div class="flexM">

Most developers I know never use(d) Proxy because it is a bit abstract. Well, basically you can use it for anything you'd normally have to define a lot of properties for: like this keyboard binding example.
You'll need a proper keyboard for this to work though.

<div data-jsfiddle="a9xk6cme"></div>

</div>


### HTML to image

<div class="flexM">

Yes you can render HTML to an image, but in a weird stupid way (should be way easier).

<div data-jsfiddle="Lgm50j8y"></div>

</div>


### Golden angles

<!--<div class="flexM">-->

This is a great example how I sometimes use JSFiddle: for [the disconnect project](/project/disconnect) I needed a pattern or form to place 28 pieces of content in nine chapters. This here is the start of finding that form:

<div data-jsfiddle="ub9sztk5" style="height:38rem;flex: 0 0 var(--gold-l);"></div> 

<!--</div>-->


### A cardboard box

<div class="flexM">

Like I said: CSS is underrated.
This was created as the last example in the post about [front-end logic without JavaScript](/front-end-logic-without-javascript).

<div data-jsfiddle="sqb7Lo5e" style="height:31rem;flex: 0 0 var(--gold-l);"></div>

</div>


### Trippy background

<div class="flexM">

Totally forgot what this was for, but it looks nice. I think I was trying to figure out why background gradients rotate so strangely.

<div data-jsfiddle="xwohszrc"></div>

</div>


### Rainbow box

<div class="flexM">

An illustration for [the MC Picker blog post](/mc-picker)

<div data-jsfiddle="21wo6bc0" style="height:27rem;flex: 0 0 var(--gold-l);"></div>

</div>


### Zandloper

<div class="flexM">

This spinner used on this site

<div data-jsfiddle="4n12ytxf"></div>

</div>


### CSS background

<div class="flexM">

Just a nice background-gradient in CSS ([think I saw it here](https://nxtmuseum.com/)).

<div data-jsfiddle="v37cn5gk"></div>

</div>


### Text gradients

<div class="flexM">

Totally forgot about text gradients

<div data-jsfiddle="w5udqrf2"></div>

</div>

## That's about it

There's more, but I didn't want to make this post too long. Hope you liked it.
