<p>I used to draw a lot when I was younger. These days I code more but I still love it to make something visual without having to worry about dependencies and cross-platform functionality.<br />
Some of it I do with an ordinary black ballpoint, some of it on a wacom and some of it by way of fingerpainting on a tablet. And then there&#8217;s the cross-over called Filter Forge.</p>
