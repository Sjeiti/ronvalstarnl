# Whooohooo

<p>My snowflake filter has gone high usage. HU nr5 means free <a href="http://www.filterforge.com?affiliateid=200070920" target="_blank">Filter Forge</a> lifetime upgrades. YES!!!<br />
Well, if I had actually done some paid work instead of playing around with <a href="http://www.filterforge.com?affiliateid=200070920" target="_blank">Filter Forge</a> I would have been able to buy it a long time ago. But it&#8217;s way nicer to earn it this way.</p>
