# Birds

Another nice subject diverging from front-end development is birds. Before, I just loved nature related things, not birds specifically. Although İ did donate to [Vogelbescherming](https://www.vogelbescherming.nl/help-mee/steun-ons/word-lid) (because it is a good environment end-boss) and İ did get several birding books for my birthday.
A few months ago İ started listening to the [Vogelspotcast](https://www.vogelspotcast.com/) and thought İ'd buy my first binoculars. Then I was hooked.

After a trip to [İlperveld](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ge7rTHQx3UKgMJH27) and [Westhoffplas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UriSVkx2gpqwwVeTA) İ decided İ also needed a good camera. İ am a complete noob, so a lot of determination is done afterwards, which is difficult when you have to go on memory or sloppy mobile photos..

Luckily İ had an old camera, so all İ needed was a zoom lens. These first photos are nothing special, like I said: I'm a birding noob. İt is just a really funny pose of a grey heron, from the perspective of an unsuspecting fish.
