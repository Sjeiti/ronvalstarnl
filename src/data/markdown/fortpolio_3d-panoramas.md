# 3D panoramas

<p>Iwan Baan is a photographer. Part of his work entails photographing buildings for architects using a fish-eye lens. He used to show clients the results with a Director application. But technologies shift. I ported his work to Flash. Later on I build the same viewer again in HTML5.<br />
I improved small things to the original application: caching and load times, user interface improvements, screen transitions.</p>
