# PaperVision3D 2 alpha

<p>The long awaited version 2 alpha is out. Well it has been out for about two weeks but I haven&#8217;t had time to look into it. I&#8217;ve cooked up a little something to try it out together with some <a href="http://www.filterforge.com?affiliateid=200070920" target="_blank">Filter Forge</a> filters: check it out.<br />
There are of course still some things that need to be fixed, but hey, it&#8217;s an alpha.</p>
