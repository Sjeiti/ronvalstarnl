# Experiment: CSS background with radial gradients

Over the past weeks I came upon [this old fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/Sjeiti/v37cn5gk/) in [my last post](/jsfiddles), saw some iOS screen or whatever, and was thinking it had been a while since I made [an experiment](/search/experiment).
Since I still like single element thingies I started coding this animated radial background gradient.

It's a single background seeded with a prng and animated with Perlin noise.

I'll save the detailed explanation for a later post. I just wanted to share the source and some cool varieties.
