# Chocolátl

<p>A new store in the Jordaan called Chocolátl. And it sells chocolate :-}<br />
Together with graphic designer Ibrahim Farah a website for the store was created: clean and staightforward. Both Ibrahim and I are now a bit more addicted to chocolate.<br />
There&#8217;s also rumor of a webshop being developed.</p>
