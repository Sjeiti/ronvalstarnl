# Chocol&#225;tl

A new store in the Jordaan called Chocol&#225;tl. And it sells chocolate.
Together with graphic designer Ibrahim Farah a website for the store was created: clean and staightforward. Both Ibrahim and I are now a bit more addicted to chocolate.
There&#8217;s also rumor of a webshop being developed.
