# canvasImg

<p>I&#8217;ve just put up the first version of <del data-href="https://canvasimg.ronvalstar.nl/">canvasImg</del>. It&#8217;s a JavaScript object that you can use to create transitions between images. You can apply it to a canvas, an image and any other tag that has a background-image set inline.</p>
<p>So check it out <del data-href="https://canvasimg.ronvalstar.nl/">here</del> and please: if you have any ideas, feedback, pointers, whatever: don&#8217;t hesitate to mail me or comment here. It&#8217;s a first version (still a bit messy) so I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s lots of room for improvement and/or expansion.</p>
