# WordPress Pocket widget

<p><a href="http://getpocket.com/" target="_blank">Pocket</a> is really handy. It is a way to save articles and access them cross-device. It has an API and is also on <a href="http://ifttt.com" target="_blank">IFTTT</a>.<br />
I use Pocket to save articles I see on <a href="http://zite.com/" target="_blank">Zite</a> and interesting stuff I encounter during the day.<br />
In between work I&#8217;m currently rebuilding my two sites into one and thought it would be nice to share the articles I read (the interesting ones anyway). So I built a plugin for it that you can even hook up to your own Pocket app id: <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/pocket-widget/" target="_blank">Pocket widget</a>.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>To get it the easiest is to search for &#8216;Pocket widget&#8217; from within your WordPress backend. Or download it from <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/pocket-widget/" target="_blank">here</a>. Because I&#8217;m rather fond of how Github works I have <a href="https://github.com/Sjeiti/Pocket-Widget" target="_blank">the main code</a> setup there. The svn on WordPress will be distilled from there. So submitting issues/tickets is better to do on Github.</p>
