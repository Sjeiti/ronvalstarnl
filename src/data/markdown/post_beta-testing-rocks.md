# beta testing rocks

<p>Well, the bullet is through the church (always fun to just translate a Dutch saying into English). The <a href="http://www.filterforge.com?affiliateid=200070920" target="_blank">Filter Forge</a> beta test ends. This product is really cool. And <a href="http://www.filterforge.com/more/freecopy.html" target="ff">giving away free copies</a> for good beta testing is even cooler. I thought well&#8230; fifteen.. maybe thirty lucky people tops. But these guys are insane. The&#8217;ve just given away <a href="http://www.filterforge.com/more/news/973.html" target="ff">threehundredeleven</a> copies to the beta testers for submitting filters, bug reporting, suggestions and good behaviour. Now that is gratitude. I hope the&#8217;ve got some people left to sell it to :-P.<br />
It was really fun to be one of the beta testers (and I&#8217;m not just saying that because I&#8217;m one of the lucky ones). I haven&#8217;t had much time to submit any filters recently but I&#8217;m sure I will in the future. Maybe now is a good time to put these seamless filters to good use in <del data-href="http://www.papervision3d.org/">a totally different beta test</del>. It&#8217;s about time I learned as3 anyway.</p>
