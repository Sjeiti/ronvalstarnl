# Boon Learning

To turn their bespoke e-learning platform into a subscription based one a customisable redesign was needed.
Another front-end developer and I created the foundation front-end framework to integrate with their existing sources. These sources are in [Haxe](https://haxe.org/), which is obscure but similar to languages I'm familiar with. We wrote documentation and created the first two customisable styles.
