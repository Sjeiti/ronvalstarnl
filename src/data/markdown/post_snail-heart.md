# A snail heart

Here is another of my [favorite microscopy videos](/seedling). I is a really tiny snail. I'm not sure about the exact size but you can see a blurry coleps zipping by, and some algae. (I love coleps btw)

I like how this tiny snail is so transparent, you can see its tiny heart beating.
