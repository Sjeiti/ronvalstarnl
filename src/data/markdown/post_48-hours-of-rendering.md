# 48 hours of rendering

<p>I had an error in my &#8216;estimated time left to render&#8217;. After 24 hours it was at minus threethousand percent :-p but I didn&#8217;t dare stop the render: thought it a shame to just discard those 24 hours of rendering, and I hoped/guessed it would be done soon. But it kept on rendering for 48 hours, and the result isn&#8217;t even that great. It&#8217;s not that rendering a movie this long is that slow, it were just way too many iterations for the resolution.<br />
But at least I know the application itself is stable!</p>
