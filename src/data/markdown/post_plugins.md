<p><a href="?page_id=276"></a>I&#8217;ve sort of completed my first WordPress plugin: <a href="?page_id=276">a stats page</a>. This is basicly what I had in my former cms. Even though I use <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics" target="_blank">Google Analythics</a> for stats I also want the data to reside on my own server to do stuff with it like <a href="http://sparkline.org/" target="_blank">sparklines</a>.<br />
Writing these plugins is quite easy (no wonder wp is so popular). So next in line are: a good upload tool, stats sparklines extension and a librarything plugin.</p>
