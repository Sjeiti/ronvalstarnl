# 2007

I know it's a bit late for newyears wishes but it was featured at <a href="http://www.shapers.nl/" target="s">Shapers</a> and I never really got round to stashing it here so&#8230; better late than never. The reason I want to bring it to attention is a particle emitter. The smoke, the arrow and the sparkles are all done with te same particle emitter. It is an as2 class I build from scratch. I'll finish it up and post it here if anybody is interested (so holler if you want it).
