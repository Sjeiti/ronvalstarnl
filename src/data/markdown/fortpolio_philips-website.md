# Philips website

For the responsive re-make of the Philips a demo was made by de Voorhoede. The demo had to be turned into workable code.
I helped setting up the the JavaScript coding guidelines for structuring and documenting the components. We used JSDoc to generate source code documentation.<br />
The scrum team I was part of also implemented the first few (and most difficult) components. There were about 140 components, the bulk of these were later implemented by MediaMonks.
