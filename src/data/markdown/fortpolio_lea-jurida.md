# Lea Jurida

<p>Lea Jurida is a sound designer. In her site, the emphasis should be on natural sound. An interesting technique I invented for this site, is the way of loading content. Normally search engines can not index the content of a Flash site. But in this case loads the Flash site xhtml content, which is simply the index.html.</p>
<p>In the mean time, Apple killed Flash and <a href="http://www.jurida.com/">Lea&#8217;s new website</a> is plain old HTML again.</p>
