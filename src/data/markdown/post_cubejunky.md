# cubejunky

After some time playing around with <del data-href="http://www.papervision3d.org/">papervision3d</del> (
<del>helloworld3</del>, <del>primitives</del>, <del>chocolateblur</del>, <del>add</del>) I started recreating my old Cubejunky game. The end is not in sight yet (all work and no play) but I still want to give you a little preview of what's to come: <del>Cubejunky in pv3d</del>
