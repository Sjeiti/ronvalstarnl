# as3 or p55

<p>I have this <a href="javascript:Sjeiti.showIFrame('coderef.php?id=625',800,600,'attractor viewer')" title="attractor viewer">attractor viewer</a> written in <a href="http://processing.org/" target="p55">Processing</a>. I wanted to finish it up a bit: calculate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_exponent" target="wiki">Lyapunov exponent</a>, save to movie, save online, etc. The problem is it&#8217;s written an older version of Processing. Then I thought: why not try as3 on for size. It&#8217;ll be faster for me to write since my Processing is getting a bit rusty. Well <a href="javascript:Sjeiti.showCode('code/attractors.swf', 800,600, 'attractor viewer')" title="planet">I got halfway</a> and I&#8217;m going back to Processing for this. Just compare a million iterations in <a href="javascript:Sjeiti.showIFrame('coderef.php?id=625',800,600,'attractor viewer')" title="attractor viewer">Processing</a> to the same <a href="javascript:Sjeiti.showCode('code/attractors.swf', 800,600, 'attractor viewer')" title="planet">in as3</a>. Processing kicks Flash&#8217;s ass! I just hope Processing has gotten a little better while I was away. I do hope I&#8217;ll be able to save movies.</p>
