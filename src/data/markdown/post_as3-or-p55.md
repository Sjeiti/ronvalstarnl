# as3 or p55

I have this <del>attractor viewer</del> written in [Processing](http://processing.org/). I wanted to finish it up a bit: calculate [Lyapunov exponent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_exponent), save to movie, save online, etc. The problem is it’s written an older version of Processing. Then I thought: why not try as3 on for size. It’ll be faster for me to write since my Processing is getting a bit rusty. Well [I got halfway](javascript:Sjeiti.showCode('code/attractors.swf', 800,600, 'attractor viewer') "planet") and I’m going back to Processing for this. Just compare a million iterations in <del>Processing</del> to the same <del>in as3</del>. Processing kicks Flash’s ass! I just hope Processing has gotten a little better while I was away. I do hope I’ll be able to save movies.
