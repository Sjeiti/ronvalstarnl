# Studyblend v2

In 2014 developed the Studyblend application for (and with) Shapers.

Studyblend is a blended learning tool designed by the pioneers of learning experience design.

Because of the good track-record and overall feedback on the ease of use we decided to rebuild it from the ground up with up-to-date technologies. This also allows to add new features that are difficult to implement in the old version.
