# PSP browsing

<p>My girlfriend gave me a <a href="http://www.yourpsp.com/psp/psp.html" target="psp">PSP</a> for my birthday. One of the first things I did was get online and check out that <a href="http://www.access.co.jp/" target="netfront">Netfront</a> browser that comes with it. The browser is great: HTML4, CSS2, javascript 1.5. Creating websites for it is a bit hard. There are only a few websites that tell you the ins and outs. I wrote an article (link removed) about creating PSP websites, mainly because I found out some stuff I couldn&#8217;t find anywhere online. I&#8217;ll keep it updated.<br />
Next thing to research is the PSP&#8217;s javascript capabilities. For starters I wrote <del>a little javascript keyboard</del>, you can download it and easily customize it to your own needs. Next todo of course is a javascript game, let&#8217;s see how far I can go.</p>
