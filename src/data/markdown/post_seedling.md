# A seedling
 
When I started this blog I would often write about other things than just front-end development. Since I gave up freelancing a while back, I spend a lot less time playing around (all work and no play).
So I thought I'd show some of the stuff I do apart from front-end development; one of which is microscopy.

Here is one video that I really like. Mostly I just collect water from wherever. This time a small seed got in (probably grass). Over the period of a few days I kept it moist and under a cover slip.

The most magical thing is that you can see particles within the roots going back and forth!
