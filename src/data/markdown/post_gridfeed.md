# jQuery.feedQuilt

<p>Ever since I changed <a href="/" target="_blank">ronvalstar.nl</a> into something more comfortable I wanted to give ronvalstar.nl a quick haulover (change it into the same style, revise structure and content, upgrade from WordPress 2.3 to 2.8&#8230; etc&#8230;). So I just did but it&#8217;s still bit of a mess, I&#8217;ll get to that someday&#8230;</p>
<p>I made a new cool <a href="#">jQuery plugin</a> while I was at it. At first I wanted to incorporate the <a href="http://www.last.fm/widgets" target="_blank">Last.fm quilt widget</a>. But the simplicity of the widget into another Flash overkill made me reconsider: this could easily be done with <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a> and not only for Last.fm.</p>
