<p>Some things weren&#8217;t working quite well so I started updating the cms to the most recent version. Of course in a test dir with a test db. Then I stumbled onto the root and my entire @$%#%**^ site was gone. Well, not entirely gone, there&#8217;s just no output. It took me a day or two but now it&#8217;s working again, plus I threw in a little redesign just for the fun of it, and some better jquery javascript. I still have to check the database for posts with old javascript and re-edit some pages. But at least it&#8217;s up and running again.</p>
