# TinySort

<p>I needed something to sort html nodes so I wrote it.<br />
TinySort is a small script that sorts any nodetype by it&#8217;s text- or attribute value, or by that of one of it&#8217;s children. It started out as a jQuery plugin but was rewritten to loose the jQuery dependency (current browsers can easily do without).</p>
