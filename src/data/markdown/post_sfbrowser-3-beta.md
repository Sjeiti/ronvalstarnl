# SFBrowser 3 beta

<p>I&#8217;ve made some major changes to SFBrowser. It will now be able to work with other server side languages than PHP.<br />
I also implemented a structure so SFBrowser can be extended with plugins. To show I&#8217;ve added two plugins: filetree and imageresize.<br />
Plus a ton of other minor changes: dragging, resizing, caching, cookie support etc&#8230;<br />
Before I merge this with the trunk I will need to test and bugfix this version.<br />
If you care to test you can get it here:<br />
