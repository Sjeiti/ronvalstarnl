# HTML5

<p>Normal people read a good book before they go to sleep. I normally do to, but yesterday I read <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5-diff/#webarch" rel="external">this document</a> on HTML 5 (on my PSP, in case you&#8221;re wondering if I have a computer in bed).<br />The changes are really promising: a new content model concept (display:static/block/inline), menu and command elements, datagrid, focus on defining the semantics in detail, and I wonder what &#8221;sandboxing for iframes&#8221; means.<br />So when will it be ready? I first thought the previous was a joke or something, because I read at <a href="http://www.w3.org/News/2009#item119" rel="external">W3C</a> that their XHTML2 working group is going to be assigned to HTML5 the end of this year. But then I searched a little further and it seems HTML5 will indeed be ready in 2022 (not a typo: twothousandtwentytwo). But but but&#8230; that&#8221;s twelve years from now! I&#8221;ll be an old man by then!</p>
