<p>At StillsnMotion robotic arms are sold that accurately rotate around objects to take photographs. For StillsnMotion I developed a cross-platform application that converts these images to a cross-browser and cross-device HTML5 application.<br />
The application is provided with a user, and license key. This encryption is also implemented in the final HTML5 application making it very difficult to steal by third parties.</p>
