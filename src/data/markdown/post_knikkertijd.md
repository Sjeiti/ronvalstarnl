# knikkertijd

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dn1rmdjs5/image/upload/v1566568756/rv/marbles.jpg" style="border:1px solid;margin-right:15px;" align="left" />Knikkertijd is dutch for &#8216;marbletime&#8217;: a few times a year there would be a period of a few days/weeks that the main game played at the schoolyard was marbles.

<del>This flash 8 application</del> used two displacement maps per marble: one for the underground, and one (mod width) for the glass swirl inside the marble. I do plan to put some more gaming elements in there, but for now just go <del>knikkeren</del>.
