# Papervision3D

<p>ActionScript 3 is easy as pie, it just looks a bit scary at first. As I mentioned earlier I had a look at <a href="http://papervision3d.org/" target="pv3d">Papervision3D</a> (a 3D engine for Flash) and decided it would be a good oppurtunity to take up as3 (and test some of <a href="http://www.filterforge.com/filters/author651-page1.html" target="ff">my filters</a> in 3D at the same time).<br />
After some fiddling around I noticed that the only primitives in Papervision3D were a plane, a paper plane (whieeee) and stars (?). No cube, no sphere&#8230; hey <a onclick="javascript:Sjeiti.showIFrame('test/pv3d/sphere.html',640,480,'sphere',this)" href="javascript:v();">I can do spheres</a><a onclick="javascript:Sjeiti.showIFrame('coderef.php?id=635',525,277,'also sphere',this)" href="javascript:v();">.</a> So next in line are: cylinder, cone, torus and cube. And if I feel bold I might try some polyhedra.<br />
So that&#8217;s my little contribution to the Papervision3D project: coded 3D primitives. It&#8217;s not much (especially not compared to what <a href="http://www.unitzeroone.com" target="uz1">this person</a> does) but as they say here: all little bits help.</p>
<p>-update-</p>
<p>&#8230; and that&#8217;s four <a href="javascript:Sjeiti.showIFrame('/test/pv3d/primitives.html',640,480,'primitives')">primitives</a> (well, actually it is three: the cone is really a cylinder).</p>
