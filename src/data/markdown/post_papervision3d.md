# Papervision3D

ActionScript 3 is easy as pie, it just looks a bit scary at first. As I mentioned earlier I had a look at <del data-href="http://papervision3d.org/">Papervision3D</del> (a 3D engine for Flash) and decided it would be a good oppurtunity to take up as3 (and test some of <a href="http://www.filterforge.com/filters/author651-page1.html" target="ff">my filters</a> in 3D at the same time).
After some fiddling around I noticed that the only primitives in Papervision3D were a plane, a paper plane (whieeee) and stars (?). No cube, no sphere&#8230; hey <del>I can do spheres</del>. So next in line are: cylinder, cone, torus and cube. And if I feel bold I might try some polyhedra.
So that&#8217;s my little contribution to the Papervision3D project: coded 3D primitives. It&#8217;s not much (especially not compared to what <a href="http://www.unitzeroone.com" target="uz1">this person</a> does) but as they say here: all little bits help.

-update-

&#8230; and that&#8217;s four <del>primitives</del> (well, actually it is three: the cone is really a cylinder).
