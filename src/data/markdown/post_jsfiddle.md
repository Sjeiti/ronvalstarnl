# JSFiddles

There are quite a lot of online sandbox environments online in which you can quickly mockup HTML, CSS and JS. There's [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [plnkr](https://plnkr.co/), [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com), [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) and [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/) to name a few.

I myself have always been fond of JSFiddle. No particular reason why I would use it over the other sandboxes mentioned, maybe it's the simplicity. I do use CodeSandbox from time to time if I want to quickly test something more complex.

```html 
<!--example-->

<style>
p {
  font-family: 'Source Code Pro', monospace;
  font-size: 1.25rem;
}
</style>
<main>
  <p>I even coded the code examples in my site in such a way that you can open them as JSFiddle if you press that button --></p>
</main>
<script>
  console.log('See?')
</script>
``` 

## Ten years equals threehundredandforty fiddles

I have been using JSFiddle for about ten years now. That is 17 pages of fiddles, which amounts to 17*20=340 fiddles. Since I never bothered to clean it up it is of course filled with junk. But there are some nice little gems in there that are maybe worth showing. So I thought I'd sift throught them and show you the nice ones (and maybe cleanup along the way).

### The oldest

The nice thing about this one is that it is the oldest one, written with jQuery, using `setTimeout`, systems Hungarian notation. All stuff I don't do anymore. But we all came from somewhere, had phases, do everthing we used to do differently now. Except using `asdf` for quick names, `asdf` and `poepjes`.
