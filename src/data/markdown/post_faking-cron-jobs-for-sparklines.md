# faking cron jobs for sparklines

<p>I did search for a fake cron job plugin of course (I wouldn&#8217;t want to reinvent the wheel). But <a href="http://www.skippy.net/blog/category/wordpress/plugins/wp-cron/" target="_blank">the only one</a> I could find does not make a difference between bots and humans. If that doesn&#8217;t matter for you the plugin is worth a look (it also comes with a couple of plugins that make use of it). But for me this simply doesn&#8217;t cut it. So <a href="?page_id=288">I reinvented the wheel</a>, only mine has less spokes but shinier hubcap.<br />
The reason I needed the cron job is the sparkline to the right here: &#8216;unique vs bots&#8217;. It shows you how many of you visitors are not human (which is quite a lot&#8230; scary huh). The image is updated every hour. In due time I will also release this sparkline widget but it still needs a lot of work.</p>
