# Design United 2020 

Every year the Dutch Design Week is held in Eindhoven. And every year [four Dutch universities](https://design-united.nl) collaborate to showcase work under the flag of Design United.
Together with [Shapers](https://shapers.nl) I built [this years exhibition site](https://2020.design-united.nl) where each day of the week would also have a liveshow streamed (due to Covid). The site itself is a React SPA onto a Wordpress REST API.
I created custom Gutenberg blocks to expose specific data through the REST API.
