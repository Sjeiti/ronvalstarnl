# Ome Willem

<p>For this website Ome Willem&#8217;s famous show was the central theme. You see the decor as interface. Buttons to different pages are sheets of paper hanging on the wall behind the Ome Willem-figure. When you press a button all sorts of things happen that have to do with that page. In the shop for example you can pull on the clothesline with hats and t-shirts. The content pages have a real cut-and-paste feel because we really made them with crayons and felt-tip pen.<br />
Besides a guestbook, there is also a birthday calendar that visitors can fill. On their birthday they get an actual SMS with congratulations from Ome Willem.</p>
