# Mitsubishi Colt

<p>The Mitsubishi Colt has undergone a restyle. This minisite was part of a cross-media campaign for the vehicle. Technically, the site is quite heavy; a compromise between quality and quantity. The site contains three interactive 360 ??Â° panoramas with hotspots for specific parts. The panoramas flow seamlessly into each other and contain many background sounds that pan across the cars.</p>
