# about

I love writing [JavaScript](/search/javascript). So naturally I also know a lot about [DOM](/search/dom), [HTML](/search/html) and [CSS](/search/css).

My formal background is graphic- and interaction design and I strive toward consistency and cleanliness in both code *and* design.

The recurring theme in my work is bringing structure in the chaos. This can be streamlining a [build](/search/build), ordering components into a [semantic](/search/semantic) context, or knowing when to apply which [HTMLElement](/search/HTMLElement). Code must structured from the bottom up with the help of linting, unit tests, component tests and end-to-end tests.
I care greatly about code quality backed by tests and build processes but I also think the strictness should reflect the team's experience.

Another thing I like to work on are [speed](/search/speed) optimisations, whether it be in build processes, JavaScript code or CSS markup.

A substantial portion of my work is writing documentation: how and why is a codebase structured in a certain way.

## stack

Among the JavaScript frameworks and libraries I've used are [React](/search/react), [Vue](/search/vue), [Angular](/search/angular), [Backbone](/search/backbone), [jQuery](/search/jquery), [ThreeJS](/search/threejs). But I will never start projects with a specific framework by default. The choice to add abstractions should be weighed carefully.

For backend I mostly resort to [NodeJS](/search/node) or [PHP](/search/php). The latter often with [Laravel](/search/laravel) or [Wordpress](/search/wordpress). But I've also used Java, Python and .NET. You might say *full-stack*, but I don't believe that is really a thing.

## clients

In the course of time I have worked with: Randstad, Vodafone, Novartis, Philips, ThiemeMeulenhoff, Resn, 2x4, BNN, Pool Worldwide, Tribal DDB, Kennisnet, Centraal Museum and Ome Willem!

As of december 2023 I landed my first job at [the Volksbank](https://www.devolksbank.nl/) where I'm part of the team responsible for the design system.

## past

My programming endeavors started with a book about Basic and and MSX.
Professionally I began around 1996 with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Then Lingo (Director) and Flash (only animation at that time).
When I graduated (Interaction Design) I started a company called [Shapers](https://shapers.nl). Director died, Flash became big. I started programming more JavaScript and ActionScript and learned PHP along the way.
In 2004 I started using Processing (and Java) for private projects.
I quit Shapers in 2007 and started freelancing.
Then Flash died in 2011 and I was back coding good old JavaScript applications. And now also using [GLSL](/search/GLSL).

## education

<small>(I also have a BA and an MA, but with <span data-from="1997-01-01"></span> years of work experience titles hardly matter)</small>

## also...

I have a wife and a son. I've been baking my own bread for about <span data-from="2015-04-04">nine</span> years. I'm part of a [gardening collective](https://www.icanchangetheworldwithmytwohands.nl). I like to put stuff [under a microscope](https://vimeo.com/showcase/9363359). I am a retired ninja.
