# about

<p>I love writing <a href="/search?s=Javascript">Javascript</a>. So naturally I know a lot about: <a href="/search?s=DOM">DOM</a>, <a href="/search?s=HTML">HTML</a>, <a href="/search?s=CSS">CSS</a> <small>(LESS, SASS)</small>, <a href="/search?s=XML">XML</a>.<br />
Streamlining build processes is also one of my favorite pastimes, especially since <a href="/search?s=NodeJS">NodeJS</a> finally fully supports ES6.<br />
For my backend needs I mostly resort to <a href="/search?s=PHP">PHP</a> (<a href="/search?s=Laravel">Laravel</a>, <a href="/search?s=Wordpress">WordPress</a>, <a href="/search?s=Codeigniter">Codeigniter</a>), but I&#8217;ve also touched base with Java and Python.<br />
I&#8217;ve used several Javascript frameworks and libraries (<a href="/search?s=Angular">Angular</a>, <a href="/search?s=Vue">Vue</a>, <a href="/search?s=Backbone">Backbone</a>, <a href="/search?s=jQuery">jQuery</a>, <a href="/search?s=ThreeJS">ThreeJS</a>).<br />
In the past I&#8217;ve coded a lot <a href="/search?s=Actionscript">Actionscript</a> and sometimes <a href="/search?s=XSLT">XSLT</a>, <a href="/search?s=Java">Java</a>, <a href="/search?s=Processing">Processing</a>, <a href="/search?s=Air">Air</a> and even <a href="/search?s=Lingo">Lingo</a> (Director, remember ?!).</p>
<h2>role</h2>
<p>In a team my role is mostly lead- or senior front-end developer. I care greatly about code quality backed by build processes. But I also think the strictness should reflect the team&#8217;s experience.<br />
Since my background also encompasses graphic- and interaction design this strive towards consistency also emerges in those fields.<br />
As a result I feel right at home in agile work flows like scrum.</p>
<h2>clients</h2>
<p>In the course of time I have worked with: Randstad, Vodafone, Novartis, Philips, ThiemeMeulenhoff, BNN, Pool Worldwide, Tribal DDB, Lukkien, Nationale Nederlanden, Kennisnet, Lost Boys, Centraal Museum and Ome Willem!</p>
<h2>past</h2>
<p>My programming endeavors started with a book about Basic and and MSX.<br />
Professionally I began around 1996 with HTML/CSS and Javascript. Then Lingo (Director) and Flash (only animation at that time).<br />
When I graduated (Interaction Design) I started a company called <a href="http://www.shapers.nl" target="_blank">Shapers</a>. Director died, Flash became big. I started programming more Javascript and Actionscript and learned PHP along the way.<br />
In 2004 I started using Processing (and Java) for private projects.<br />
I quit Shapers in 2007 and started freelancing.<br />
Then Flash died in 2011 and I was back coding good old Javascript applications.</p>
<h2>education</h2>
<p><small>(I also have a BA and an MA, but with years of work experience titles hardly matter)</small></p>
