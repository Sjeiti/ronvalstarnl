# about

I love writing [JavaScript](/search/javascript). So naturally I also know a lot about [DOM](/search/dom), [HTML](/search/html) and [CSS](/search/css).
My favorite work is streamlining [build](/search/build) processes, refactoring and optimizing DOM and JavaScript for [speed](/search/speed).

Among the JavaScript frameworks and libraries I've used are [React](/search/react), [Vue](/search/vue), [Angular](/search/angular), [Backbone](/search/backbone), [jQuery](/search/jquery), [ThreeJS](/search/threejs). But I will never start projects with a specific framework by default. The choice to add abstractions should be weighed carefully.

For backend I mostly resort to [NodeJS](/search/node) or [PHP](/search/php). The latter often with [Laravel](/search/laravel) or [Wordpress](/search/wordpress). But I've also used Java, Python and .NET. I'm not full-stack though, that's a dumb term.

## role

Sometimes I work on solo- or open-source projects but mostly I like to work in teams. 
In a team my role is mostly lead- or senior front-end developer. I care greatly about code quality backed by build processes. But I also think the strictness should reflect the team's experience.

My formal background is graphic- and interaction design and I strive toward consistency and cleanliness in both code *and* design.

## clients

In the course of time I have worked with: Randstad, Vodafone, Novartis, Philips, ThiemeMeulenhoff, Resn, 2x4, BNN, Pool Worldwide, Tribal DDB, Kennisnet, Centraal Museum and Ome Willem!

## ethics

There is work that I've done in the past that I would no longer take on today. My morals have changed.
I no longer do hardcore commercial work; I will not help sell products nobody needs. I will not work for (most) banks or insurance companies. I will not work on anything bitcoin related. <!-- Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, Nestle, Coca Cola, oil companies -->
Everybody is responsible. You cannot be responsible for everything but you should at least try; nothing is in vain when you're part of a chaotic system.

## past

My programming endeavors started with a book about Basic and and MSX.
Professionally I began around 1996 with HTML/CSS and JavaScript. Then Lingo (Director) and Flash (only animation at that time).
When I graduated (Interaction Design) I started a company called [Shapers](https://shapers.nl). Director died, Flash became big. I started programming more JavaScript and ActionScript and learned PHP along the way.
In 2004 I started using Processing (and Java) for private projects.
I quit Shapers in 2007 and started freelancing.
Then Flash died in 2011 and I was back coding good old JavaScript applications. And now also using [GLSL](/search/GLSL).
