# about

I love writing [JavaScript](/search/javascript). So naturally I also know a lot about [DOM](/search/dom), [HTML](/search/html), [CSS](/search/css) and even [XML](/search/xml).
My favorite work is streamlining [build](/search/build) processes, refactoring and optimizing DOM and JavaScript for [speed](/search/speed).

Among the JavaScript frameworks and libraries I've used are Angular, Vue, React, Backbone, jQuery, ThreeJS etc... But I will never start projects with a specific framework by default. The choice to add abstractions should be weighed carefully.

For backend I mostly resort to [NodeJS](/search/node) or [PHP](/search/php). The latter often with [Laravel](/search/laravel) or [Wordpress](/search/wordpress).
But I've also mandhandled Java, Python and .NET.

## role

In a team my role is mostly lead- or senior front-end developer. I care greatly about code quality backed by build processes. But I also think the strictness should reflect the team's experience.

Since my background also encompasses graphic- and interaction design this strive towards consistency also emerges in those fields.

## clients

In the course of time I have worked with: Randstad, Vodafone, Novartis, Philips, ThiemeMeulenhoff, Resn, 2x4, BNN, Pool Worldwide, Tribal DDB, Kennisnet, Centraal Museum and Ome Willem!

## past

My programming endeavors started with a book about Basic and and MSX.
Professionally I began around 1996 with HTML/CSS and JavaScript. Then Lingo (Director) and Flash (only animation at that time).
When I graduated (Interaction Design) I started a company called [Shapers](https://shapers.nl). Director died, Flash became big. I started programming more JavaScript and ActionScript and learned PHP along the way.
In 2004 I started using Processing (and Java) for private projects.
I quit Shapers in 2007 and started freelancing.
Then Flash died in 2011 and I was back coding good old JavaScript applications. And now also using [GLSL](/search/GLSL).

## education

<small>(I also have a BA and an MA, but with years of work experience titles hardly matter)</small>
