# Komkommertijd

<p>Not much going on at this side of the web. I am keeping very busy at <a href="http://www.shapers.nl/" target="_blank">Shapers</a> of couse. And <a href="http://www.filterforge.com/" target="_blank">Filterforge</a> keeps me busy as well, as you can see on the background: done with a filter I called <a href="http://www.filterforge.com/filters/1227.html" target="_blank">Splatter</a>. Another nice one I recently did was <a href="http://www.filterforge.com/filters/1187.html" target="_blank">Baroque Frame II</a>. A bit corny I agree, but it works great in projects like these (better scores alter the frame, it&#8217;s in Dutch though).</p>
