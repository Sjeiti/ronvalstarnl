# Project Invoice

This invoicing application stores all your data on your local machine. None of the data is shared between different browsers or computers.  
Project Invoice is accessible offline after the application has been loaded for the first time. You can turn it into a mobile-web-app by using the add-to-home-screen from your mobile browser.

It started from a personal need but ended up a full fledged open-source project. That means end-to-end tests, unit tests, semver, milestones, the works.
