# learning a new language

<p>I&#8217;m not so good at languages. I mean real languages, not programming languages (those are easy). I&#8217;m going to a Croatian course but you have to get a big vocabulary to really say something more substantial than &#8216;one beer please&#8217;. Learning words from books is not really my cup of tea so I thought I&#8217;d make something online to practice. Using jQuery and Google-language I conjured up a little page. On it you can add words to categories that are saved as a cookie on your computer.<br />The only weird thing is that Google-language sometimes translates stuff quite weirdly. For instance: I wanted to add the word &#8216;bear&#8217; to it from Dutch to Croatian. It returned &#8216;pivo&#8217; (Croatian for beer) probably because the Dutch word for &#8216;bear&#8217; is &#8216;beer&#8217;. So I tried it the other way around: I know &#8216;bear&#8217; is &#8216;medvjed&#8217; in Croatian. It translated that into the Dutch word &#8216;dragen&#8217; (which is to carry or to bear). At first I thought Google had made another <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YYM209GJoE&#038;NR=1">Hungarian phrasebook</a> but obviously it first translates any languages to English before translating it into another. If you put in full sentences it mostly comes out right though.<br />
Initially I made it Dutch-Croatian, but my girlfriend is learning French, and the girl I share my studio with is learning Spanish so I turned it into an anything-anything eeeh thing.<br />
The Dutch word for blindly-learning-stuff-by-heart is &#8216;stampen&#8217; (to pound) so I called it <del data-href="https://stampomatic.ronvalstar.nl/" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13px;">stamp-o-matic</del> (still a work in progress).</p>
