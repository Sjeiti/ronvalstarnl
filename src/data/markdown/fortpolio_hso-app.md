# HSO app

<p>The Wageningen University normally uses Blackboard. But Blackboard is a rather cumbersome tool. So some teachers had an idea for a web application to allow teachers and students to track their progress during the course.</p>
<p>Together with Shapers I developed a single-page responsive web application to do just that. The initial idea was to use it as an abstraction layer onto Blackboard but technical restrictions did not allow that. So all data is from a separate database. We used Laravel to create a REST service.</p>
<p>Students can watch and update their progress throughout the course by completing tasks. Additionally, there are tasks set per week that students have to complete or upload for review.<br />
Teachers can follow the progress of all students and make changes to the course.</p>
