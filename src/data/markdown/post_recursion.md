# recursion

<p>Been really busy lately, so it&#8217;s been quite a while since I did something in processing (not since the beta release actually). So to get going again I made <a href="javascript:pop('coderef.php?id=627',0,0,400,400)">this recursion thing</a>. I also did it in color but plain old b/w looks better.<br />
The concept is not my idea, I got it off <a href="http://www.iotic.com/" target="_blank">iotic</a> who has done it in shockwave. I just wanted to see the speed in processing.</p>
