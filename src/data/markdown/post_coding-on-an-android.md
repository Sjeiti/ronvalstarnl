# coding on an android

<p>I&#8217;ve always found that taking ones computer on vacation is rather pointless. Then why go on vacation! I guess in this day and age you cannot bring your phone along anymore either.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>So I&#8217;m hooked to programming. When we were in Mediteranian paradise I found out that the <a href="http://mytracks.appspot.com/">My Tracks</a> app on my Hero also exports the GPS data to CSV and I just couldn&#8217;t help myself. I just had to write a JavaScript visualisation&#8230; in a rudimentary text editor on a HTC Hero, without JavaScript error notices, without internet acces, without being able to enter TAB characters. I didn&#8217;t have anything better to do.</p>
<p>The following takes place <a href="http://maps.google.nl/maps?f=q&#038;source=s_q&#038;hl=nl&#038;geocode=&#038;q=Trstenik,+Orebi%C4%87,+Hrvatska&#038;sll=52.380432,4.869778&#038;sspn=0.012194,0.016716&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;hq=&#038;hnear=Trstenik,+Orebi%C4%87,+Dubrovnik-Neretva+%C5%BEupanija,+Kroati%C3%AB&#038;ll=42.924252,17.425432&#038;spn=0.058513,0.100679&#038;t=h&#038;z=14">here</a>. The first is a drive from Trstenik to Dra?e, the second a walk from Dra?e to Janjina. The line thickness represents the elevation and the color the speed (both relatively).</p>
