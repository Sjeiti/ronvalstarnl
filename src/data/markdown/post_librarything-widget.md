# Librarything widget

<p>Finished <a href="?page_id=284">the librarything widget</a>. It was a bit of a hassle to get the &#8216;<a href="http://automattic.com/code/widgets/" target="sidebar">Sidebar Widgets</a>&#8216; to work since I&#8217;m not using the standard theme. But if you have WordPress 2+ and the classic or kubrick them you should have no trouble at all to get this to work. Well even if you don&#8217;t have a standard theme it&#8217;s still not that difficult to install, I&#8217;m just stupid sometimes :-p.</p>
