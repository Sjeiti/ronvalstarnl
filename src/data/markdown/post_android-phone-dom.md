# Android phone DOM

<p>Cleaning up my phone the other day I found some cool stuff. Two years ago I coded <a href="/?p=604">some stuff</a> while I was on vacation. This was also on it&#8230;</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Anyway, here&#8217;s a little thing I wrote on a phone to see what the DOM on that phone browser really looked like.</p>
<p><a href="http://test.ronvalstar.nl/DOM/">http://test.ronvalstar.nl/DOM/</a></p>
<p>Types are neatly color coded, objects and functions can fold, and booleans toggled.</p>
<p>Vacation or not, I just can&#8217;t go that long without coding anything.</p>
