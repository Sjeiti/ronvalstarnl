If we take a grid size of ten pixels in a hundred pixel field the number of particles will be around 10&#215;10=100 (or possibly 11&#215;11=121 if you round the edges correctly). The x/y position of each gridpoint will act as seed for a psuedo random number generator.

# Experiment: snow

<p>This might look simple but it is actually a simple implementation of a more complex solution. Normally particles are deterministic. This means a position of a single particle in time can only be determined by extrapolating from it&#8217;s previous position.<br />
The particles you see here are procedural: their position in time is predetermined plus their number is infinite.<br />
You can check this by dragging left or right which also reverses time. The particles will go in exact reverse, even the ones that were already off-screen.<br />
