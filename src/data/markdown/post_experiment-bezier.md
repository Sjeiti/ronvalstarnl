# Experiment: bezier

I recently stumbled upon [an article](https://ciechanow.ski/drawing-bezier-curves/) that interactively explains how bezier curves work. You don't need to know all this when drawing with canvas (which has Bezier curve methods). But I did make a GLSL version just to see the difference.
