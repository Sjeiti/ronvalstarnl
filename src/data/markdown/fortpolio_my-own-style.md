# My Own Style

My Own Style is a webshop where users can also customise their own products. A shoe for instance can be made up of five variable parts.
I translated the graphic designs into templates and implemented the in WordPress with Woocommerce as a webshop.
Since customizeable products are rather tricky I had to code numerous implementations myself where normally you&#8217;d use existing plugins.
