# Experiment: flow field

<p>A flow field is a <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field">vector field</a> used to move particles. In this case the field is provided by a 3D Simplex field (2D and time).<br />
The number of particles is dynamic; particles are added and removed to reach an optimal framerate.</p>
