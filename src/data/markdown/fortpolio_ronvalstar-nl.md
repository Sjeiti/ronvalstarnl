# ronvalstar.nl

<p>The medium is the message when you take yourself seriously as a front-end developer. So when the first version of the WordPress REST API was born I was quick to try it out with a single page Vue front end.</p>
<p>Which is the means by which you&#8217;re reading this now: the CV on my site is fed by a custom written projects plugin and can easily be exported to PDF. Because I don&#8217;t like to repeat myself, and I like keeping things in one place.</p>
