# Tinysort v2

<p><a href="https://tinysort.sjeiti.com">TinySort</a> just had a major release to v2. The jQuery dependency is now removed. So it is not a jQuery plugin anymore but a &#8216;standalone&#8217; script without dependencies. It is also a fraction smaller and a bit faster.<br />
TinySort now also has AMD support and it&#8217;s on CDN.</p>

<p>Hopefully people won&#8217;t be too confused/dissapointed/pissed-off. I had been neglecting this project a bit lately. The biggest reason is that I have not been using jQuery for the past two years. The current state of browsers is so good jQuery is becoming obsolete. All you really need these days are ES5/6 shims.</p>
<p>I know making TinySort pure-js must feel like going from GUI to CLI for some people but it&#8217;s really for the best (but if you really really insist: it does have a jQuery wrapper).<br />
So here&#8217;s a challenge for your next project: no jQuery. No convenient black-box abstraction layer but pure JavaScript. You might even learn a thing or two about the DOM.</p>
