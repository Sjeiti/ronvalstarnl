# Blauwe planeet

<p>For Thieme Meulenhoff, Shapers developed a series topography CD-ROM&#8217;s for group 7, 8 and 9. The CD-ROM&#8217;s provide a complete, fun and effective way to learn topography They are part of the method &#8216;Blue Planet&#8217;. Later on, part of the series was ported to Flash to make it available online. We took the opportunity ??to improve it interactive and graphically.</p>
