# referer

<p>One of the nicer types of statistical data must be $_SERVER[&#8220;HTTP_REFERER&#8221;];&#8230; escpecially when those referers contain <del>another statistics page</del>. Which is how I found this interesting link: <a href="http://www.generative.net/" target="_blank">generative</a>.</p>
