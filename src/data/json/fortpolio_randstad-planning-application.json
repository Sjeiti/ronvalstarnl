  "content": "<p>I worked on the internal application Randstad uses to plan people for their clients. This is an old application and was somewhat outdated. A previous attempt was made to renew the client side of things but it failed miserably when for instance loading and searching a few thousand records.<br />\nSo a scaffold framework was setup by Mirabeau. Next I was called in to implement all the things. The target goal was to recreate the entire web application responsively, keeping in mind that there are clients that have over a few thousand records. Due to size and complexity (and also a bit of GDPR) this took wel over two years to accomplish.</p>\n",
