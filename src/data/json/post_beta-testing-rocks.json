The&#8217;ve just given away <a href=\"http://www.filterforge.com/more/news/973.html\" target=\"ff\">threehundredeleven</a> copies to the beta testers for submitting filters, bug reporting, suggestions and good behaviour. Now that is gratitude. I hope the&#8217;ve got some people left to sell it to :-P.<br />\nIt was really fun to be one of the beta testers (and I&#8217;m not just saying that because I&#8217;m one of the lucky ones). I haven&#8217;t had much time to submit any filters recently but I&#8217;m sure I will in the future. Maybe now is a good time to put these seamless filters to good use in <a href=\"http://www.papervision3d.org/\" target=\"pp\">a totally different beta test</a>.
