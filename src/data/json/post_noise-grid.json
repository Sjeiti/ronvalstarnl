But what if you want points that are spread irregularly, a forest for instance or a starfield. This can be done with Perlin noise as well. You take a grid, place it over the noise field. Then you use the each points noise value as angle for a translation (multiplied with an insanely large number). The length of the translation would depend on the type and size of your grid, in a triangular grid this would be the distance between two points in that grid.<br />\nI used a threshold here to create &#8216;blobs&#8217; of points. Of course the &#8216;thickness&#8217; of the pointclouds will be exactly the same as that of the grid.<br />\nUse keyboard or mouse to switch between states.</p>\n",
