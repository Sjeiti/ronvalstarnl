As with most toys, you play around with them for a while but eventually they end up on a shelf somewhere.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>This year I wanted to get a good camera for macro photography. I didn&#8217;t get one yet (still have to pick one out). But I did find some good use for my microscope putting my simple Panasonic onto the eyepiece (I got the idea after doing something similar this vacation with some binoculars).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/wordpress/wp-content//uploads/img/blog/microleaf.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>And since I have a stereo microscope (and photoshop) I thought I&#8217;d try to make some stereoscopic photos. To my surprise it works out really well. It takes some trial and error since I have little control over the focus of my camera, and I have to color-correct each side when putting the two fotos together.</p>\n<p><!--img src=\"wp-content//uploads/img/blog/micromint.jpg\" /--></p>\n<p>Too bad you can&#8217;t zoom in with stereoscopic 3D.<br />Oh wait&#8230;. of course you can&#8230; (mousewheel)</p>\n<div id=\"stereozoom\"></div>\n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"test/stereozoom/scripts/base.js\"></script><br />\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"test/stereozoom/scripts/drawIcon.js\"></script><br />\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"test/stereozoom/scripts/stereozoomer.js\"></script><br />\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"><!--\n\twindow.onload = function(){\n\t\tstereoZoomer.init(\"stereozoom\",467,367,\"test/stereozoom/data/mint.jpg\");\n\t\t\t\t\tvar aImgs = [\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \"butterfly.jpg\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t,\"chrysalis_head.jpg\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t,\"crystal.jpg\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t,\"flyhead.jpg\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t,\"flyheadside.jpg\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t,\"flyshoulder.jpg\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t,\"lichen.jpg\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t,\"mint.jpg\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t,\"sandurchin.jpg\"\n\t\t\t\t\t];\n\t\t\t\t\tvar mZoom = document.getElementById(\"stereozoom\");\n\t\t\t\t\tvar mUl = addChild(mZoom ,'ul');\n\t\t\t\t\tfor (var i=0;i<aImgs.length;i++) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmLi = addChild(mUl,'li');\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmA = addChild(mLi,'a');\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmA.setAttribute(\"href\",\"javascript:stereoZoomer.loadImg('test/stereozoom/data/\"+aImgs[i]+\"')\");\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmA.appendChild(document.createTextNode(aImgs[i].split(\".\")[0]));\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t}\n--></script></p>\n<p>More zoomeable images <a href=\"http://test.ronvalstar.nl/stereozoom/\" rel=\"external\">are here</a>.
