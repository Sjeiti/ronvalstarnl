I care greatly about code quality backed by build processes. But I also think the strictness should reflect the team&#8217;s experience.<br />\nSince my background also encompasses graphic- and interaction design this strive towards consistency also emerges in those fields.<br />\nAs a result I feel right at home in agile work flows like scrum.</p>\n<h2>clients</h2>\n<p>In the course of time I have worked with: Randstad, Vodafone, Novartis, Philips, ThiemeMeulenhoff, BNN, Pool Worldwide, Tribal DDB, Lukkien, Nationale Nederlanden, Kennisnet, Lost Boys, Centraal Museum and Ome Willem!</p>\n<h2>past</h2>\n<p>My programming endeavors started with a book about Basic and and MSX.<br />\nProfessionally I began around 1996 with HTML/CSS and Javascript. Then Lingo (Director) and Flash (only animation at that time).<br />\nWhen I graduated (Interaction Design) I started a company called <a href=\"http://www.shapers.nl\" target=\"_blank\">Shapers</a>. Director died, Flash became big. I started programming more Javascript and Actionscript and learned PHP along the way.<br />\nIn 2004 I started using Processing (and Java) for private projects.<br />\nI quit Shapers in 2007 and started freelancing.<br />\nThen Flash died in 2011 and I was back coding good old Javascript applications.</p>\n<h2>education</h2>\n<p><small>(I also have a BA and an MA, but with years of work experience titles hardly matter)</small></p>\n",
