Actually did about half of it on an iPad at night on <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/\">JSFiddle</a> (a six week old baby made me do it). And its great fun trying to hack your code from 1400 to 1024 bytes, especially when you end up with 1016 and have 8 more bytes to squander. But the best thing is you really get to seek the edges of a language and find all these forgotten operators or statements (I almost forgot about ~ for instance).</p>\n<p>Well anyway&#8230; here&#8217;s my entry. It&#8217;s not the best on the list but it looks nice and I had fun doing it.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"width: 100%; height:400px\" src=\"http://js1k.com/2012-love/demo/1113\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>ps: is looks like I failed copy-pasting the source when submitting&#8230; so here&#8217;s <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/Sjeiti/xepaG/\">a jsfiddle to it</a>&#8230;</p>\n",
