What would it be like to wake up one day and find that you are the last person on earth that is truly alive.</p>\n<p>This website is the online manifestation of an audiovisual performance called Disconnect. The performance and the website tell the story of the inventor of a neural network to which consiousness can be uploaded. Then the inventor wakes up from a coma and finds everybody gone.</p>\n<p>The site is a weird one, reminiscent of the glory days of internet when sites did not all look like a WordPress theme from a can.<br />\nTechnically it is one big show off:<br />\n&#8211; Threejs with a lot of custom GLSL shaders<br />\n&#8211; video playing on the texture of an object<br />\n&#8211; same for audio but with subtitles<br />\n&#8211; transformation of HTML elements into GLSL shaders<br />\n&#8211; a working (but limited) command line interface<br />\n&#8211; post-processing shaders</p>\n<p>What was really cool is the way the site came about. Robin Coops came to me with the story but not really with a clear idea on what to build. He did already have the video/renders Wilbert van Veldhuizen made. From there I started experimenting. It just grew. Suzanne from Nonstopcollective created visuals for text-content. Eric Magnée did sound design and background music. And at some point it just came alive.</p>"}
