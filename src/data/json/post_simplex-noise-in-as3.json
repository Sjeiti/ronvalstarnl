The test class also shows the spread and speed of both Perlin (left) and Simplex noise (right).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/classicVsSimplex.jpg\" alt=\"classic vs simplex noise\" style=\"border:1px solid grey;\"/></p>\n<p>&#8211; oh but wait &#8211;</p>\n<p>I just notice the great <a href=\"http://toxi.co.uk/\">Toxi</a> (aka Karsten Schmidt) also has taken Stefan Gustavson&#8217;s version and improved/modified it a bit in his <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/toxiclibs/source/browse/trunk/toxiclibs/src.core/toxi/math/noise/SimplexNoise.java\">Toxiclibs</a>. And this one is in 4D!!! (I was wondering why <a href=\"http://gist.github.com/304522\">Sean McCullough</a> wasn&#8217;t doing anything with the simplex lookup table).<br />K&#8230; let&#8217;s see what this one does in as3&#8230;</p>\n<p>Alrighty&#8230; <a href=\"/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/simplexAs4D.rar\">new version here</a>. It&#8217;s not much faster but it does have 4D!</p>\n<p><del><small>Ps: I&#8217;ve also changed the first link in this post, old link is <a href=\"/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/simplexAs4D.rar\">this</a>.</small></del></p>"}
