This prevents the trouble you go through when your client decides to add another x amount of pixels to the dimensions.<br />\nNow I only got this IE glitch online, and only on my Vista OS. XP was working fine for me, but on other machines XP did the same thing. That&#8217;s already quite random behavior but it probably has to do with the Flash plugin version.<br />\nThe first time the page loads everything is fine. But if you reload, or navigate away and go back, both the stageWidth and the stageHeight are 0 on the first cycle. This is probably due to cashing and initializing but a Flash plugin bug nonetheless. A way to circumvene this problem is to run an enterframe and only startup the lot when the stageWidth and -Height are something else than 0. Or hardcode these values of course, but who would want that?<br />\nHope this helps some desperate souls out there.</p>"}
