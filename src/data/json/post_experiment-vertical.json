This would work just fine were it not for something called cross domain policy (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing\">CORS</a>).</p>\n<p>When you call toDataURL on a Canvas that has an image from another domain you get the beautifull notice: &#8216;Tainted canvases may not be exported&#8217;. One solution is to set an attribute <code>crossOrigin=\"anonymous\"</code> to the IMG element that loads the image. This will load only images where CORS is set, so it will not taint when we draw to Canvas. The downside is that it might take a while to find an image where CORS is set (check console).</p>\n<p><del datetime=\"2016-02-24T08:53:27+00:00\">ps: see that search button/field above? When you enter something without submitting, and then click the Canvas, the Google image search will use that query.

I completely ditched the search option and settled for a placeholder image service that has a random in their REST options: <a href=\"https://unsplash.it/\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a>.</p>\n<pre><code data-language=\"javascript\" data-src=\"/wordpress/wp-content/themes/sjeiti/static/experiment/vertical.js\"></code></pre>"}
