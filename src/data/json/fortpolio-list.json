In the shop for example you can pull on the clothesline with hats and t-shirts. The content pages have a real cut-and-paste feel because we really made them with crayons and felt-tip pen.<br />\nBesides a guestbook, there is also a birthday calendar that visitors can fill. On their birthday they get an actual SMS with congratulations from Ome Willem.</p>\n",

Elasticsearch is extremely fast. The downside is that it takes a whole different mindset because it seems limited compared to regular databases where you can easily execute a joined query for instance.</p>\n<p>The script itself is relatively small. CSS and HTML are parsed into the script through the build process using the headless browser <a href=\"http://phantomjs.org/\">PhantomJS</a>. For other dependencies CDN&#8217;s are used.</p>\n<p>Bootstrap is used for the CSS basis but this can be disabled at will. The layout is very easy to override since the CSS the script provides is injected to <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document.styleSheets\">document.styleSheets</a> rather than simply added to the DOM.</p>\n<p>The build process also generates documentation and examples using Markdown with <a href=\"http://usejsdoc.org/\">JSDoc</a>.</p>\n",

A strange attractor is not complicated, but because it is deterministic it needs a few billion iterations for a proper result. September last year Chrome dropped support for Java applets. Since Javascript has come a long way I thought I&#8217;d try a remake in Nodejs. I compared a rough to a client-side implementation and found the speed difference negligible enough to bring the entire implementation to client-side Javascript.<br />\nContrary to the old Java applet <a href=\"http://attractors.ronvalstar.nl\" target=\"_blank\">this Javascript version</a> can burp out animated gifs and webm videos.</p>\n",
