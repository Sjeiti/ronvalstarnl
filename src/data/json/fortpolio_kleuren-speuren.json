The aim is to catch all the chameleons by searching in six different color spaces that are accessible from the courtyard. In every room six chameleons are hidden. To find a chameleon, you must accomplish a task. If you do it well, the chameleon appears and you can catch him. When all chameleons are caught you will have the best chance of winning the bonus game. </p>\n<p>In 2004 Kleuren Speuren was nominated for the Gouden Apenstaart.</p>"}
