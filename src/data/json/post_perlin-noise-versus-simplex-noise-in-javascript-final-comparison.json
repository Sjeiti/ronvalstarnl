What you don&#8217;t see in the example is that the simplex noise is a bit denser, which is probably caused by the triangulating way the noise is calculated. I&#8217;ve corrected this in the canvas output by multiplying it by 1.5 (that number is nothing more but a wild guess, it looks ok though).</p>\n<p>Also very obvious is the range of the noise. The simplex noise low and high values approach 0 and 1 more often. I&#8217;ve run some tests between the two types to find the lowest and highest values with different octave and falloff values. The classical Perlin noise does go near 0 and 1 but it just seems more mediated, or the simplex one is more evenly spread. Altogether, the simplex version seems more chaotic than the classic. So in theory you&#8217;d need less octaves for a similar visual effect.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/perlinAndSimplex.rar\">Click here</a> to download the example, and feel free to comment or mail if you have any ideas for improvement.</p>\n<p>Well, I guess I&#8217;ll go and port the simplex to as3 now.</p>"}
