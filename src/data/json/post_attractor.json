An attractor is deterministic, meaning that it&#8217;s state at a certain point in time can only be calculated by iterating toward that point in time.</p>\n<p>There is a nice anecdote about this. The University of Stockholm (Sweden) held a contest. He who finds a way to predetermine the position of three planets in any given point in time (the three body problem) would win 2500 crones and a gold medal.<br />\nIn January, 1889, the entry that was declared the winner was that of the French mathematician <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9\">Jules Henri Poincarï¿½</a>. He was invited to Sweden to collect his prize.<br />\nBut shortly after (in the middle of the printing for the first publication) Poincarï¿½ found an error in his calculations. The three body problem was unsolvable after all.</p>\n<p>This also shows how something seemingly simple as a planet and two moons can actually be a chaotic system.<br />\nSimplicity is also one of the beautifull properties of strange attractors. For example the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz\">Lorenz</a> attractor is this:</p>\n<p class=\"code\">xx = x + e*( (-a*x*d) + (a*y*d) )<br />\nyy = y + e*( ( b*x*d) &#8211; (y*d) &#8211; (z*x*d) )<br />\nzz = z + e*( (-c*z*d) + (x*y*d) )</p>\n<p>resulting in this:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"lorenz\" class=\"ill\" src=\"/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/lorenz.jpg\" /></p>\n",
