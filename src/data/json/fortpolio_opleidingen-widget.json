  "excerpt": "<p>An Elasticsearch Javascript widget comprised of CDN dependencies, with source-generated documentation and examples.</p>\n",
  "content": "<p>The total of educations that can be followed in the Netherlands amount to a reasonable pile of data. Studiekeuze123 wanted something with which to search this data. It also had to be easy to implement and customiseable. The result is a single script that connects to an <a href=\"http://www.elasticsearch.org/\">Elasticsearch</a> server.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Our reason for choosing Elasticsearch was speed. Elasticsearch is extremely fast. The downside is that it takes a whole different mindset because it seems limited compared to regular databases where you can easily execute a joined query for instance.</p>\n<p>The script itself is relatively small. CSS and HTML are parsed into the script through the build process using the headless browser <a href=\"http://phantomjs.org/\">PhantomJS</a>. For other dependencies CDN&#8217;s are used.</p>\n<p>Bootstrap is used for the CSS basis but this can be disabled at will. The layout is very easy to override since the CSS the script provides is injected to <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document.styleSheets\">document.styleSheets</a> rather than simply added to the DOM.</p>\n<p>The build process also generates documentation and examples using Markdown with <a href=\"http://usejsdoc.org/\">JSDoc</a>.</p>\n",
